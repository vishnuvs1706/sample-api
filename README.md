# Sample API

This is a sample api. 

## Technology Used
- [x] [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [x] [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)
- [x] [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org)
- [x] [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
- [x] [Flyway](https://www.red-gate.com/products/flyway/community/)
- [x] [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are expected:

- ORIGINS: comma separated list of [allowed origins](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/).
- POSTGRES_SERVER: URL of db server
- POSTGRES_USER
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD
- POSTGRES_DB: postgres DB name

### DB adaptor

The [psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org) adaptor is used. Note the [installation requirements](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html) for the psycopg2 package. The [sample-api dependencies](pyproject.toml) use the psycopg2 package and not the psycopg2-binary package.
    
## Local Development

### Running locally

- Run `docker compose up` command from root directory to start the entire stack. The following will be started: 
  - Postgres server 
  - Flyway - it setups the postgres tables and inserts some dev data.
  - sample-api server
- Environment variables are defined in the docker-compose.yml
- The `sample-api` folder is volume mounted, so any changes to the code will be reflected in the container 
- The API's documentation is available at [http://localhost:3003/docs](http://localhost:3003/docs).


### Unit tests

- Run `docker compose --profile test up` command to run the unit tests from the root directory. This will run the above services as well as the unit tests.
- The folder is volume mounted, so any changes to the code will be reflected in the container and run the unit tests again.


## The API

This is a simple API. It is not production ready. 

The API is based on the table schema defined in [V1.0.0__init.sql](db/migrations/V1.0.0__init.sql) file. Note the foreign key constraint if you want to try the endpoints out.

The [http://localhost:3003/docs](http://localhost:3003/docs) page lists the available endpoints.
